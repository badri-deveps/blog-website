my blog website 
Purpose: A blogging platform where users can write, edit, and delete their posts. The
blog allows users to interact with the content by submitting their own articles, providing
an open platform for writing and publishing content.
tech stack:The backend can be created with either Flask or Django, which are both
Python-based web frameworks. The frontend is styled using Bootstrap, a CSS
framework that offers pre-designed templates and components to make the design
process easier. This system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
Delete) operations on blog posts.
